 # How to contribute

I would appreciate any contribution. I am not seeking much feedback on feature request, but mostly on refining code and improving my coding skills. If you find my code lacking (not a bit "if") and provide better solutions or can make improvements, I would be happy to merge them if they make sense.

All contributions will be under AGPL as the main project, I don't ask for DCO, but if you could sign-off your commits, that would be appreciated. Please describe your contribution in the PR and don't be shy providing context: I am a novice programmer. If you see some good code, most likely it's not mine (@yamanq has done a great job).

 Thanks

 Carlo
